`rorm-lib` provides FFI bindings for [rorm-db](https://github.com/rorm-orm/rorm-db).

With the help of this crate, it is possible for other languages to use the orm.

The API definition can be generated by using `cbindgen`:

```bash
# Install / update cbindgen
cargo install -f cbindgen

# Generate header
cbindgen --crate rorm-lib --config cbindgen.toml --output rorm.h
```

The generated header file is located in `./rorm.h`.

To provide a similar experience as `rorm` for users, it is required to build 
an additional layer upon this binding as well as an interface for `rorm-cli`.
